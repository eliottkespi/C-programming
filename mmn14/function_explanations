do first run

is label ?
	if is directive
		data
			add the data 1 by 1 to the image table + count data words + sybol table
		string
			add string to the image table + count the data words + symtable
		entry
			;
		extern
			add new symbol with extern turned on
		else
			invalid
	else if is instruction
		add to symtable and count the instructions word
		

else if is directive ?
	data
		add the data 1 by 1 to the image table + count data words
	string
		add string to the image table + count the data words
	entry
		;
	extern
		add new symbol with extern turned on

else if instruction
	count 

else 
	invalid line


implemetation stages:
	1. write code
	2. validate compilation
	3. validate a simple a run is workin even without argument
	4. validate that test1/from_mmn_14 is running wihtout issue and compare it to the output
	5. start to see what you did:
		a. basic testing
		b. deep testing
		c. disaster testing

second run:

while fgets
	is label ?
		move to next word
	is directive
		is entry
			turn on the entry value in symtable
		is extern
			add to new data structure (label_name, address) 
	is instruction 
		validate/count num of operands
		for every operand
			check addressing type
			check value
		prepare code to be used - create 1st word - with opcode, addresing src/dst, are
		add to image 
		if needed
			prepare code
			add to instruction image
